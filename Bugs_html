<DIV>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Something must be done to avoid 8bit characters in 'IMG SRC' (maybe others?)
Netscape seens to understand but I dont think it will work with all browser
<P>
<LI>Netscape doesnt handle CSS very well. After the 'TABLE' it doesnt display
the font color of 'BODY' defined in CSS
<P>
<LI>text-transform: uppercase is not working for 8bit characters (like รก, รง, etc)
<P>
<LI>files cant start with a '-'. Will be fix soon.
</UL>
</DIV>
