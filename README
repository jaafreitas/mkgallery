How it works:
	just enter in a folder with a lot of images and it will create for you
	the thumbnails and webpages for you. Easy? :)

What we need:
	wow, really a lot of tools... Maybe the most dificult one is the convert
	utility which comes with ImageMagick, but you can use another program to
	do this job (create the thumbnails).

To do: there are some parts of the script that sounds little bad for me, so why
	dont you suggest improves to it? :)

Futures: we have a lot of functions in the script, so its really easy to change
	part on it. We have a gallery_start, gallery_end and other things to
	make it cleaner. We also have CSS and HTML 4.0 validy pages checked with
	the validator in the W3C website. One of the most interesting things is
	we can change all colors with the gallery.css file. We dont need to
 	recreate all pages because we decided to change the background color :)

Bugs: 
	NONE! :) Bug I would like to hear if you found one :)
