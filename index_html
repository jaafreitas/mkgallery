<li><STRONG>How it works:</STRONG>
	Enter in a folder with jpg files and choose a name for the gallery.
	You can also specify other option in the command line. See the help
	('mkgallery -h') for more information.
<P>
<li><STRONG>What we need:</STRONG>
	Basicly we need ImageMagic packages (convert and identify). The other
	utilities are essential in any Unix system.</p>
<P>
<li><STRONG>Features:</STRONG>
	The script is divided in many functions to help we change anything
	without breaking other functions. In the files start_html and
	end_html we can put html code to be inserted in the top and bottom
	respectively. All pages are HTML 4.0 checked with the validadtor in
	the W3C website. With the CSS file is possible to change any color,
	font, style without changing all HTML pages. Also you can specify
	only one css file for all your pages. Comments can be added for
	any image.
