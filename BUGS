* Something must be done to avoid 8bit characters in <IMG SRC> (maybe others?)
Netscape seens to understand but I dont think it will work with all browser

* Netscape doesnt handle CSS very well. After the <TABLE> it doesnt display
the font color of <BODY> defined in CSS

* text-transform: uppercase is not working for 8bit characters (like á, ç, etc)

* files cant start with a '-'. Will be fix soon.
